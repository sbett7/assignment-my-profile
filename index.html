									<h3>My Interests in IT</h3>
									<p>
											<span class="image left">
												<img src="imgs/soccer_robot.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;height:350px;"/>
												<p>
														I have had an interest in IT since my years in high school.  In my final years of high school, I was looking into possible careers that I could move into and found a
														description on the Mechatronics Engineering field.  I found it interesting that it focused on combining different areas of electrical, mechanical and software engineering
														to develop automated systems and robots.  When I graduated from high school, I began studying Mechatronics Engineering for 3 years, before I decided to move to Software Engineering.  
														During that time I was involved in many robotic projects, such as building a robot that could play soccer.
														I also worked for an IT support company for a year to complete my Work Integrate Learning requirement for the degree.
													</p>
													<p>
														I have chosen to come to RMIT to help sharpen my skills in the IT industry.  I am currently looking for work, after having completed my Bachelor of Engineering degree.
														During this time, I wanted to try and maintain my current skill set, as well learn new skills.  I felt that RMIT would provide me with the flexibility to study while looking for work
														and eventually joining the IT industry.
													</p>
													<p>
														Throughout the course of my studies, I expect to gain more experience in the skills that I have developed in my previous studies.  However, I am also looking to learn new 
														skills such as web development, which I have not had much exposure to.  I am also looking to learn more about networks and the security around them, as well as how to develop software for them.

											</div>
										</article>
										<article >
												<div>
													<h4>My Interpretation of the Results</h4>
													<p>
														The big five personality test and the Myers-Briggs test indicate that I am introverted and struggle with social interactions.  They also indicate that I prefer hard facts over guesses
														and assumptions.  They also indicate that I am responsible, and dependable when others need my help, but am less likely to get involved with others on a personal level.  The two tests 
														indicate that I like to plan and make early decisions and preparations, however my personality test indicates that I am able to try new things and focus on new problems.  
														My learning style indicates that I predominantly learn through visual stimulus and by performing tasks related to the content.  I struggle to learn from auditory input.
													</p>
													<p>
														I believe that these results will influence my behaviour within the team right from the outset.  I have noticed that in projects that I have been a part of, that I will take
														some time to warm up to the team before I begin to openly work with others and offer my ideas.  I also believe that as I become more comfortable with my team, I will be more involved in helping them when they have issues with 
														something they are working on. However, I would also argue about decisions on the project that have not been supported by facts.  
														  I also try to keep my team members at a distance, and maintain only a working relationship with them.  With regards to my learning style, I think that I 
														would struggle to understand the thoughts and ideas of a team member if they tried to explain something to me vocally, I believe it would take me less time to understand if they showed me or we performed the task that 
														they were explaining.
													</p>
													<p>
														With regards to forming a team, I believe I should choose a team of individuals that are similar in nature.  I believe I would work better with individuals that had a desire to make 
														decisions based on facts and not feelings.  I believe it would be necessary to have an extroverted member within the team to help support in the initial stages, as it would take 
														some time for those that are only introverted to become comfortable with each other.   When forming the team, it would also be better to choose individuals that are work-oriented and dependable.

									<h3>Project Idea: Alexa-Pi Robot</h3>

									<section>
											<div class="container">
													<p>
														The project is focused on the development of a robot that is controlled using Amazon’s voice-assistant, Alexa.  The aim of this project is to use the Amazon Alexa services to send 
														voice commands to a robot to make it move around a room.  This robot will consist of a Raspberry Pi to act as the communication relay and controller for the robot, and an Arduino 
														Uno to control the motors of the robot.  The user will then provide a voice command to the voice-assistant, which will be transmitted to and translated by the Raspberry Pi.  The command 
														is then sent to the Arduino Uno for it to be performed.  A Raspberry Pi camera will also be attached to the robot, which will be used to forward a camera feed or take pictures and 
														display them on an Amazon Echo device.
													</p>
													<div class="features">
														<article>
														</article>
														<article>
															<h4>Motivation</h4>
															<p>
																The motivation for this project is to develop a unique mobile robot that can be driven using specific voice commands, as well as display visual data to the user.  There are also 
																additional levels of complexity, as this project involves network configuration to deploy the video sharing feature of the robot, as well as configuring a serial communication link 
																between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno.  There have been projects that have focused on the development of robots that are controlled with Amazon’s Alexa services, and projects to use 
																the Raspberry Pi camera as a security camera that can be displayed on Amazon’s Echo devices.  However these two concepts have yet to be implemented together.  
															</p>
														</article>
														<article>
															
															<h4>Description</h4>
															<p>
																	The robot that will be developed will have several different features incorporated into its design.  This robot will be interfaced with Amazon Alexa, to allow the user to command 
																	the robot with their voice.  Using Amazon Alexa, the user will be able to provide simple commands which will cause the robot to rotate, or move.  The user will also be able to 
																	request Alexa to display a live video or still image from the camera that will be built into the robot.  For example, the user might use the following phrase:
																</p>
																<p style="text-align:center">
																		<i>Alexa, turn the robot 30° clockwise.</i>
																</p>
																<p style="text-align:center">
																		<i>Alexa, show me the view from the robot.</i>
																</p>
																	The above commands would cause the robot to rotate 30° clockwise from its current position.  The next command would access the onboard camera and transmit the live feed to the 
																	screen of the Echo device through a secure TLS connection <cite>(Machin, 2017)</cite>.  To be able to view the video stream from the robot, an Amazon Echo Show or Amazon Echo Spot will be required required.  Other 
																	commands that can be given will include requesting the robot to move in a certain direction or taking a still image.
																</p>
																<a class="image" style="height: 50%;background-color: white; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);"><img src="imgs/possible_design.jpg" alt="" /></a>
																<div class="inner" style="padding-left: 15px">
																	<p>	
																		The robot will be constructed with a light-weight chassis made of MDF board.  The chassis will have two stories, to reduce the width and length of the robot.  The Arduino and
																		the motorised wheels that will be used to drive the robot will be placed on the bottom layer, while the Raspberry Pi and camera are placed on the top layer.  The motors will be 
																		placed on either side of the chassis, with a caster while placed  near the front of the robot to support and balance it.  The Raspberry Pi camera will be placed on the front of the robot to capture 
																		everything that is in the robot’s field of view.
																	</p>
																</div>
																<p></p>
																<p>	
																	As stated previously, the robot will make use of a Raspberry Pi to act as the main processor.  All commands from Alexa will be given and processed through the Raspberry Pi, which 
																	will be able to receive those commands using the Raspberry Pi's in-built WiFi module.  The Raspberry Pi will also be connected to a camera which will be used 
																	to take photos or display a live feed directly to the user through an Amazon Echo display.  To control the movement and direction of the robot, an Arduino Uno will be used for 
																	its ability to read and write analogue signals.  This will make the movements of the robot more precise, as the Raspberry Pi does not have an Analogue converter built into it <cite>(DiCola, 2016)</cite>.
																</p>
																<p>
																	A portable battery will be attached to the robot, which will be connected to the micro-USB power connection on the Raspberry Pi.  This ensures that the robot will not be tethered to an 
																	electrical socket as it roams throughout the environment.  The Raspberry Pi will be attached to the Arduino Uno via a USB-B cable which will supply power and a data connection 
																	to the Arduino Uno, this data connection will provide a two-way communication line for the two devices.  Four AA batteries will also be attached to the robot to provide power to the two 
																	motors that will drive the robot.  Additional transistor and diodes will be used to protect the motor from a negative voltage spike <cite>(Monk, 2018)</cite>.  
																</p>
														</article>
														<article>
																<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
																<p>
																	The software that is required includes a copy of the NOOBS operating system for the Raspberry Pi, as well as a free developer’s license to the Amazon Services' developer portal.   
																	The development will be done using the Python SDK to develop the Alexa interface and the serial communication between the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino Uno.  The Arduino IDE 
																	will be used to develop the software that will be used to control the motors of the robot.

															<h4>Skills Required</h4>
															<p>
																The skills that are required for this project involve some software expertise, as well as some electrical and mechanical expertise to connect and solder the connection of the 
																motors and construct the chassis.  The software skills that are required include experience in the Python programming language, as well as some expertise in the C programming language 
																to develop software on the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino Uno.  Experience using Amazon’s Developer console is also required to develop the voice user interface that 
																will be used to invoke movement for the robot through the Amazon Echo device.   Tutorials for the development of this software are readily available, however the electrical and mechanical 
																work will require special tools, such as a soldering iron, as well as some ability in wood working to create the chassis.
															</p>
														</article>
														<article>
															<h4>Outcome</h4>
															<p>
																The outcome of this project will result in a robot that is capable of moving based on commands given to Amazon’s Alexa voice-assistant by the user.  Additionally, with the attached camera, it 
																will also allow users to view what the robot is seeing from an Amazon Echo device.  As such it will provide a cheaper option than some other options such as the Lynx robot, or the 
																Anki Cozmo Robot.  If this project is successful, it will also provide the opportunity to expand further by adding additional features, such as object recognition and waypoint movement, 
																which could be used to tell the robot to move to specific objects within its field of view.
